NavCam
======

NavCam is a project aimed to help visually impaired people crossing busy intersections.

Planned main features are:
* Detection of some roadsigns (mainly useful for pedestrians);
* Detection of red traffic lights;
* Detection of moving vehicles in front of the camera;
* Sound announcements of warnings and prohibitions.

Basic approach to detection is hue-based segmentation, contour detection and recognition.

Project is built against Android 2.2 (Froyo) currently and is using OpenCV 2.4.2 for image processing.
